Updating SLArToolkit (https://slartoolkit.codeplex.com/) to work on Windows 10 UWP

This is an incomplete port of SLArToolkit for Windows 10 UWP. I have added the capability to capture video for UWP apps,
which was the major hurdle. Some work remains to be done to make the examples work.

I probably will not have time to finish this, but if anyone would like to fork and send PRs, I will accept simple ones. 
Feel free to fork and finish your own branch, of course.
