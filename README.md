Updating SLArToolkit (https://slartoolkit.codeplex.com/) to work on Windows 10 UWP

This is an incomplete port of SLArToolkit for Windows 10 UWP. I have added the capability to capture video for UWP apps,
which was the major hurdle. 

A Beginners Guide version for Windows 10 almost works, except for camera rotation being off by 90 degrees.
