Description

The Matrix3DEx library is a collection of extension and factory methods for Silverlight's Matrix3D class. The Matrix3D class represents a 4x4 matrix that is used in combination with the Matrix3DProjection to apply more complex semi-3D scenarios to any UIElement than are possible with the simple PlaneProjection. This makes it possible to apply arbitrary model transformation matrices and perspective matrices to Silverlight elements.
The Matrix3D class is very minimalistic and has only very few members. The Matrix3DEx library tries to compensate that with extension and factory methods for common transformation matrices that are not part of Silverlight, but easy to use like built in methods.
